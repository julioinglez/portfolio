      the challenge
    %p.project-showcase-section-description
      When starting the project, Formnflow was already on a functional state, so my focus went into the UX/UI and polishing the current visual in place.
      A big part of the work went into clarifying the main workflow for the user to avoid any confusion regarding each userflow step.
-#
-# THE BEGINNING:
-#
-# At the very start, I sketched out a basic form of the new layout I had in mind. Some ideas pivoted into other ideas in the process and other ideas worked out really well.
-#
-# HIGHLIGHT:
-#
-# I have to say that I am very proud of the hand-made SVG icon library that I made for Formnflow. It helps to understand many of the user actions at a glance such as the different Form Fields available.
-#
-# FINAL RESULT:
-#
-# IMAGE
-# IMAGE
-# IMAGE

-# FEEDBACK:
-#
-# Overall the new Design and Front-end of Formnflow was a success and even though there were a lot of visual changes (users can be very reluctant to change), the clients were really happy with the result and testing carried out very smoothly.
